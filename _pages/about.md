I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science.

I am grateful to be adviced by Professor [Koushil Sreenath](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/koushil/) and working with [Xiaoyu Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G-x_szsAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Hybrid Robotics](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/index.html).

Prior to that, I was also fortunate to be adviced by [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and working with Dr. [Roei Herzig](https://roeiherz.github.io/) at [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/). Previously, I have also worked as a research assistant at Tsinghua University.

This past summer, I joined [Search-based Planning Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/search-based-planning-laboratory/) at [Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) and worked with [Rishi Veerapaneni](https://rishi-v.github.io/) under Professor [Maxim Likhachev](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/).

I am applying for PhD in the upcoming application cycles, please feel free to reach out to me!

Research Interest
======
My research interests lie in robotics and robot learning, with a focus on enabling robots to acquire sophisticated skills through learning. To that end, Iâ€™m interested in both generalizable robots that adapt across environments and expert robots tuned for high performance tasks.
