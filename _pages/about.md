I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science.

I am grateful to be adviced by Professor [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and working with Dr. [Roei Herzig](https://roeiherz.github.io/) at [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/). Previously, I have also worked as a research assistant at Tsinghua University.

This summer I am joining [Search-based Planning Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/search-based-planning-laboratory/) at [Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), working with [Rishi Veerapaneni](https://rishi-v.github.io/) under Professor [Maxim Likhachev](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/).

I am applying for PhD in the upcoming application cycles, please feel free to reach out to me!

Research Interest
======
My research interests lie in robotics and robot learning, with a focus on enabling robots to acquire sophisticated skills through learning. To that end, I’m interested in both generalizable robots that adapt across environments and expert robots tuned for high performance tasks.
