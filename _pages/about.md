I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

I am grateful to be adviced by Professor [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and working with Dr. [Roei Herzig](https://roeiherz.github.io/) at [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/). Previously, I have also worked as a research assistant at Tsinghua University.

This summer I am joining [Search-based Planning Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/search-based-planning-laboratory/) at [Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), working with [Rishi Veerapaneni](https://rishi-v.github.io/) under Professor [Maxim Likhachev](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/).

I am applying for PhD, please feel free to reach out to me!
