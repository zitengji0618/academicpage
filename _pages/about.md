I am a third-year student at University of California, Berkeley, pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, with a strong passion for the AI industry and AI research. My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience as a research assistant at Tsinghua University and later a researcher at [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) adviced by Dr.[Roei Herzig](https://roeiherz.github.io/) and Professor [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/).

Research Interest
======
My research interests are Robotics, AI Agents, and Reinforcement Learning.

Getting started

1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
